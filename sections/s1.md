## Section 1: Intro - Who am I?

Hi, Rustaceans. My name is Carlo Quick and I am a SWE at Watahan in Tokyo. Like many of you, I sometimes spend my lunch breaks thinking about Docker containers. So one day I'm sitting in the park outside work, eating a bento - if you've never had one, they're these pre-packaged meals you can get almost anywhere in Japan - and I realize I have no idea what a container actually is under the hood. (On this one particular lunch break, I found myself staring at my bento container wondering what Docker does under the hood.)

I set out to learn the basics and quickly became very interested. I don't want to get ahead of myself. We'll visit what became of my lunch later in the talk.

Today, we are going to build a Minimal Viable Rootless Container in Rust. By the end of this talk, you'll understand how containers actually isolate processes and have the tools to build one yourself.

So let's get started by understanding the differences between virtual machines and containers.
