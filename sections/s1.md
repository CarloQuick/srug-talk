## Section 1: Intro - Who am I?

Quick show of hands — how many of you use containers, like Docker or Podman, on a regular basis?

Okay — now keep your hand up if you’ve ever wondered what is actually happening under the hood.

By the end of this talk, you’ll have a concrete mental model of how containers work, and why Rust makes exploring Linux kernel concepts far more approachable.

I’m Carlo Quick. I’m a software engineer in Tokyo, and like a lot of people here, I use containers constantly.

This whole thing started on a lunch break, staring at a bento— basically a Japanese lunch box — and I caught myself thinking: I use containers every day… and I don’t actually know what a container is.

Today, we’re going to build a minimal, rootless container in Rust. Not production-ready, not Docker — just enough to see how process isolation actually emerges.

To do that, we’ll start with something familiar: the difference between virtual machines and containers.
