## 3. Rootless Containers

Containers are lightweight and portable process isolation on the host machine. Since they share the host kernel, additional security needs to be implemented to ensure proper isolation.

By default, Docker containers run as root - and that's the same root as on your host machine. If someone escapes the container, they're root on your host.

Rootless Containers run with non-root users to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

Today we'll be building a MVRC (minimal viable rootless container) in Rust.

<Terminal Demo /> or pre-recorded GIF/static image on the slide

```bash
docker run -it --name busybox-container busybox /bin/sh
    #/ whoami
    #/ sleep 1000
```

in a different terminal window

```bash
ps -aux | grep sleep
```

> Run docker container, sleep 1000, then in another terminal ps -eaf | grep sleep and show it's as root (not container root). Mention you can run docker and podman containers rootless, but aren't by default.

Now on to the Rusty-bits
